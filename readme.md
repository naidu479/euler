#Project Euler

>Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics.

Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Participants can track their progress through fourteen achievement levels based on number of problems solved. A special Eulerians level exists to track achievement based on the fastest twenty solvers of recent problems so that newer members can compete without solving older problems.

###Problems:

	* 1 - *ruby*
Add all the natural numbers below one thousand that are multiples of 3 or 5.
